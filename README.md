# Project Topic
Option 4: Text Classification Competition - Sarcams Detection on Twitter data

# Project Setup and Individual Contributions
The submitted work represents a well balanced team effort: Each of the members spend considerable time on researching potential models and frameworks. Praveen and Steven worked on and tested baseline models like SVM and random forest, Matthias focused on pre-trained models. When BERT type models turned out to be the most promising, we jointly concentrated on improving the performance of a fine tuned RoBERTa model. Praveen looked into improving accuracy via data preparation, Steven added context, Matthias experimented with hyperparameter tuning.
